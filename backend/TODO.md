# File Upload Feature Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add `/api/files/upload` endpoint to handle file uploads
- [x] Implement file storage in `uploads/` directory with unique filenames
- [x] Return file metadata (name, type, size, URL) after successful upload
- [x] Add static file serving for uploaded files at `/uploads` path
- [x] Include proper error handling and logging for file upload failures
- [x] Update CORS configuration to allow file uploads

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the file upload endpoint with frontend integration
- [ ] Update frontend components to support file uploads in chat
- [ ] Add file type validation and size limits
- [ ] Implement file deletion/cleanup functionality
- [ ] Add file preview capabilities for images/documents

## Frontend Integration Tasks
- [ ] Update DirectChat.js to include file upload input/button
- [ ] Update InternalCommunication.js to handle file messages
- [ ] Modify WebSocket message handling to include file metadata
- [ ] Add file preview in chat messages
- [ ] Test file upload from frontend to backend

## Notes
- Files are stored in `backend/uploads/` directory
- Unique filenames are generated using UUID to prevent conflicts
- Static files are served at `/uploads/{filename}` relative to the backend URL.
- CORS is configured to allow requests from frontend (localhost:3000/3001)
